			<p>As a newbie to the industry, I have worked on many an independent projects! I've made both games and<br>applications. Click the download links below the description to try each app for yourself!</p>

				<h1 style="font-size: 72px; line-height: 40px;">Slender<br>Awakening</h1>
				<br>
				<p>A reboot and tribute to the classic indie horror<br>game, Slender: The 8 Pages. This game was<br>made using Unity Engine in just over a week, and<br>was completely coded and designed by me! <br></p>
				<p>*I do not own any of the assets used in game,<br>they are under creative commons licensing.<p>

				<h1 style="font-size: 72px; margin-top: 150px;">Checkers! The<br>Game</h1>
				<p>This program was written in C# using a Windows Form. I created my<br>own rendition of the classic checkers with completely original art.<br>This game is online compatible, and can be played using an online<br>
				server application that the clients can connect to using TCP/IP. The<br>game took about a week to program, and was a fun way to learn<br>network programming along with game programming using C#!</p>

			<div class="uwuBlurb">
				<p style="line-height: 40px;">This app was a silly pet project of mine that I worked on mostly for fun. Me and friends enjoyed the cutesy "uwu"<br>language of the internet, so I programmed a translator for this "language" in Java! The application was tested on a<br>
				virtual machine and on my personal Android device, and was even submitted to the Google Play Store for a time!</p>

			<div class="TCPBlurb">
				<h1 style="font-size: 60px;">TCP/IP Messenger</h1>
				<p>Yet another Windows Form C# Application, I love the .NET Framework! It makes it easy to create visually pleasing<br>looking applications that run smooth. This app allows users to connect to a server using a unique screen name and<br>
				message with their friends! Users can change the color of the text and change their username through an in-app<br>menu. The server application is simple and communicates each message along with the name of each user that<br>
				connects. Anyone can host a server as long as they forward a port and provide users with IP Address. This application<br>was challenging to develop but was a valuable learning experience!</p>
